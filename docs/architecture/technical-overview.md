## Introduction

The Laptop Price Predictor is a machine learning application designed to predict laptop prices based on their specifications. This application transforms what would typically be a data scientist's prototype notebook into a well-structured, maintainable software application following solid software engineering principles.

The system uses historical pricing data for laptops to train predictive models, which can then be leveraged by users to estimate laptop prices based on input specifications. Beyond simple prediction, the application provides detailed model insights, exploratory data analysis, and the ability to switch between different model configurations.

This document outlines the technical architecture of the system, with particular focus on the design patterns implemented to ensure flexibility, maintainability, and scalability.

## Architectural Overview

The system architecture employs a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

│   ├── index.html
│   ├── model_info.html
│   └── visualizations.html
└── main.py                   # Application entry point
```

This architecture follows several key principles:

1. **Modularity**: Components are organized by functionality
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility
3. **Extensibility**: New models and visualizations can be added without modifying existing code
4. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has one primary purpose
5. **Open/Closed Principle**: Components are open for extension but closed for modification

## Design Patterns Implementation

The project implements three key design patterns to address specific challenges common in machine learning applications:

### Factory Pattern

**Implementation**: `model_factory.py`, `visualization_factory.py`

The Factory Pattern centralizes the creation of complex objects, hiding implementation details from clients:

```python
# Example from model_factory.py
class ModelFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_model(model_type, **kwargs):
        if model_type == 'linear':
            return LinearRegressionModel(**kwargs)
        elif model_type == 'random_forest':
            return RandomForestModel(**kwargs)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Model type '{model_type}' not supported")
```

**Benefits in this Project**:
- Enables dynamic selection between Linear Regression and Random Forest models
- Isolates the model creation logic from the rest of the application
- Provides a standard interface for all models regardless of implementation
- Makes adding new model types straightforward without changing client code

### Prototype Pattern

**Implementation**: `model_config.py`, `model_config_registry.py`

The Prototype Pattern creates new objects by copying existing ones, which is ideal for predefined model configurations:

```python
# Example from model_config.py
class ModelConfig:
    def __init__(self, model_type, features, hyperparameters=None):
        self.model_type = model_type
        self.features = features
        self.hyperparameters = hyperparameters or {}

    def clone(self):
        """Create a copy of this configuration"""
        return ModelConfig(
            self.model_type,
            self.features.copy(),
            self.hyperparameters.copy()
        )
```

**Benefits in this Project**:
- Enables predefined model configurations (Basic Linear, Optimized Random Forest, etc.)
- Allows users to start with a base configuration and customize it
- Reduces the complexity of creating valid model configurations
- Supports easy experimentation with different model settings

### Singleton Pattern

**Implementation**: `config_manager.py`, `model_manager.py`

The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance, providing a global point of access:

```python
# Example from config_manager.py
class ConfigManager:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(ConfigManager, cls).__new__(cls)
            cls._instance._load_config()
        return cls._instance

    def _load_config(self):
        self.config = {}
        # Load configuration from file or set defaults
        # ...
```

**Benefits in this Project**:
- Ensures consistent model configurations throughout the application
- Centralizes configuration management
- Prevents resource conflicts when training or using models
- Reduces memory usage by sharing a single model instance

   - Defines common interface with plot() and save() methods

2. **Concrete Visualizations**:
   - `scatter_plot.py`: For showing relationships between variables
   - `bar_plot.py`: For categorical comparisons
   - `histogram_plot.py`: For distribution analysis

3. **Visualization Factory** (`visualization_factory.py`):
   - Creates visualization objects based on requested type
   - Decouples visualization creation from usage

4. **Visualization Manager** (`visualization_manager.py`):
   - Coordinates visualization generation
   - Handles data preparation for visualization

### User Interface
